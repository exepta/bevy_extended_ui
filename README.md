Since I've been writing a game in the [_Bevy_](https://bevyengine.org/) engine lately, 
I created this crate. In my game, 
I need more complex UI elements that aren't currently supported by Bevy. 
These include sliders, choice boxes, check boxes, radio buttons, and so on. 
So I set about implementing these elements using the standard bevy_ui system. 
I'd like to make this project available to you so that you can use elements other 
than just nodes, buttons, or images. If you're missing a widget and know how 
to create it, it would be great if you could add it. 
Otherwise, feel free to create a ticket.

> *Note:* This project is currently under construction and not suitable for large projects!.
